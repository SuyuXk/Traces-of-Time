## About
- Traces-of-Time is a handcrafted Minecraft modpack deeply optimized and adjusted based on the vanilla game, designed exclusively for new players to deliver a one-stop beginner experience.

- Abandoning the overloading of complex mods, it takes tutorials as the core thread. New players can master the core gameplay of Minecraft imperceptibly while exploring the blocky world without the need for extra external guides, breeze through the novice phase, and truly savor the joy of exploration and creation in Minecraft.
